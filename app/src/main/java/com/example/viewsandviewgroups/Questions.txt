1. Define the following design principles:
    Singleton: defines a class that has only one instance
    Factory: an interface or class that creates an object and lets a subclass choose which class to initialize.

    Facade: every (abstract) factory is a facade. Hides complexities of a subsystem from the client.
    Prototype: cloning or recreating an object to be used by many

    -Linux kernel: acts as a level of abstraction between the device hardware. It also contains
     the hardware drivers of the keypad, display, camera, etc.
    -Libraries: open-source web browser engine webkit, SQLite database, SSL libraries, etc.
    -Android Runtime: this has the Dalvik Virtual Machine, which is a java virtual machine designed for Android
    -Application framework: provides many services to applications in the form of Java classes.
        -Activity Manager
        -Content Providers
        -Resource Manager
        -Notifications Manager

8. How does gradle work behind the scene?
    Gradle keeps track of tasks and makes sure they run in the correct order. Gradle also keeps track of

    task graph that are affected by a task that was changed.
